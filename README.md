## Description
An AutoHotKey script to provide a basic macro system for games that do not have one (was made for Wildstar). It initializes the color of pixels within your action bar when you push alt+enter (so have them on cooldown). Then can determine whether or not an ability is on cooldown by comparing the current color to the original color.
